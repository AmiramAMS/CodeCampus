# CodeCampus 🎓

**CodeCampus** is an open-source web platform built with **Flask (Python)** that allows beginner developers to learn, experiment, and share code in an interactive and visually appealing environment.

---

## Overview

CodeCampus is designed as a lightweight, modular web application that demonstrates:
- Backend development with **Flask**
- Frontend integration using **HTML, CSS, and Jinja2 templates**
- Persistent data storage with **SQLite**
- Separation of concerns through `static/`, `templates/`, and `instance/` directories

The project can easily be expanded into a full learning platform or serve as a boilerplate for educational tools and portfolio projects.
